                <h1>How an Obscure Photographer Saved Yosemite</h1>
                
                <p>In June of 1864, as Sherman&#8217;s armies were moving toward Atlanta and Grant&#8217;s were recovering from a bloody loss at Cold Harbor, President Abraham Lincoln took a break from the grim, all-consuming war to sign a law protecting a slice of land &#8220;in the granite peak of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.&#8221; The act granted the area &#8220;known as the Yo-Semite Valley&#8221; to the state of California, to &#8220;be held for public use, resort, and recreation...inalienable for all time.&#8221; It was the federal government&#8217;s first act to preserve a part of nature for the common good&#8212;a precursor of the National Park Service, now enjoying its centennial&#8212;and it might not have happened but for an obscure 34-year-old named Carleton Watkins.</p>
                
                <p>Born in a small town in New York, Watkins headed west in 1849 to seek his fortune in California&#8217;s gold rush, to no avail. After apprenticing to a pioneer daguerreotypist named Robert Vance, he made his money shooting mining estates. In the summer of 1861, Watkins set out to photograph Yosemite, carrying a literal ton of equipment on mules&#8212;tripods, dark tent, lenses and a novel invention for taking sharp photographs of landscapes on glass plates nearly two feet across.</p>
                
                <p>We associate Yosemite with the photographs of Ansel Adams, who acknowledged Watkins as one of &#8220;the great Western photographers,&#8221; but it was Watkins who first turned Half Dome, Cathedral Rocks and El Capitan into unforgettable sights. Weston Naef, a photography curator and co-author of a book about Watkins, described him as &#8220;probably the greatest American artist of his era, and hardly anyone has heard of him.&#8221;</p>
                
                <p>Sketches and awed descriptions of Yosemite&#8217;s grand views had reached the East in the mid-1800s, but nothing provoked public reaction like Watkins&#8217; photos, which were exhibited at a gallery in New York in 1862. &#8220;The views of lofty mountains, of gigantic trees, of falls of water...are indescribably unique and beautiful,&#8221; the&#160;<em>Times</em>&#160;reported. The great landscape painter Albert Bierstadt promptly headed to Yosemite. Ralph Waldo Emerson said Watkins&#8217; images of sequoias &#8220;are proud curiosities here to all eyes.&#8221;</p>
                
                
                <p>Watkins&#8217; works coincided with a move by California boosters to promote the state by setting aside lands in Yosemite, home to &#8220;perhaps some of the greatest wonders of the world,&#8221; Senator John Conness bragged to Congress in 1864. Historians believe that Conness, who owned a collection of Watkins photographs and was a friend of Lincoln&#8217;s, showed the images to the president the year before he signed the bill protecting Yosemite.</p>
