      <h1>How a Remote Peak in Myanmar Nearly Broke an Elite Team of Climbers</h1>
      <p>The wind slams into me, and I desperately grip my ice axes to keep from
        being ripped off the mountain face. I push my head against the snow, calm
        myself, and look down. Beneath my crampons is a 5,000-foot drop. It&rsquo;s
        like looking down from the open door of an airplane. I am roped to my two companions,
        with nothing attaching us to the mountain. A fall here would send all three of
        us plummeting to our death.</p>

        <p>When the wind subsides, I pound an aluminum stake into the snow and clip the rope to it. It wouldn&rsquo;t hold if I were to fall but gives me enough psychological comfort to continue. I concentrate, methodically swinging my ice tools and kicking my crampons. At a rock rampart I place an anchor and belay my partners, Cory Richards and Renan Ozturk, across the chasm.</p>

	        <p>&ldquo;Nice lead, dude!&rdquo; Cory shouts above the roar of the wind when he arrives. He climbs onward, slanting left, searching for a passage up through the granite and snow. When Renan reaches me, there is no room on my ledge, so he traverses out to his own perch. Cory carefully tiptoes the teeth of his crampons along a thin ledge above us and disappears from sight.</p>

	        <p>Renan and I wait, hunched against the wind. We stomp our feet and painfully slap our gloved hands. We are too far apart to talk. We just stand there, together but alone, on the side of the snow-plastered cliff more than three miles in the sky. After a half hour we begin to freeze. After an hour we can no longer feel our fingers or toes. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t take it anymore,&rdquo; Renan yells through his frozen beard. &ldquo;My feet are gone. I have to start moving.&rdquo;</p>

	        <p>We don&rsquo;t know what Cory is doing above us, but we&rsquo;re so cold it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Renan starts climbing, then I follow. We&rsquo;re all still roped together, so it&rsquo;s crucial that none of us fall. The rope is supposed to be secured to the mountain to catch a fall, but mortal predicaments like this happen often in mountaineering. When there are no good anchors, your partners become your anchors, physically and emotionally. You must trust your life to their judgment and ability, and they entrust their lives to yours. This is the code of the mountains.</p>

           <img src="http://s.ngm.com/2015/09/hkakabo-razi-climb/img/team-photo-525.jpg" />

           <p> of snow. It is too dangerous for Renan and me to keep moving. Again, we must wait. We huddle close, but we&rsquo;re still freezing. The wind swirls around our bodies, howling and biting at us like invisible hyenas. &ldquo;My feet are turnaround cold,&rdquo; Renan says. What he means is that they&rsquo;re close to frostbite.</p>

	        <p>I wonder, for at least the tenth time on this expedition, whether this is the end of our quest to climb the highest peak in Myanmar&mdash;a journey that has pushed us to our physical and emotional limits. Far below us on the mountain, our other team members are pulling for us in spirit. Our base camp manager, Taylor Rees, is at the foot of the mountain. The previous day we left Hilaree O&rsquo;Neill and Emily Harrington at camp 3, a tent nested on a snowy ridgeline, where our weary team had a bitter argument over who would try for the summit.</p>

	        <p>I tell Renan to take off his boots and place his feet underneath my down parka, against my chest. He has socks on, and my chest isn&rsquo;t exactly a furnace, but it&rsquo;s the best we can do.</p>

	        <p>When Cory makes his way around a rock buttress, we start moving. An hour passes before we finally regroup on a thin ledge. Our immediate goal remains far above us&mdash;the crest of the west ridge, glistening like the edge of a sword.</p>

	        <p>&ldquo;My lead,&rdquo; Renan says. He begins climbing, woodenly kicking his crampons into the snow. He disappears into the sun. The rope tightens, and Cory takes off. After he vanishes, I follow.</p>

	        <p>When I reach the ridge and push my ice-crusted face into the sun, it&rsquo;s like poking my head into heaven. The sudden warmth renews my hope. I pull my body onto the ridge, and a blanket of sunlight envelops me. After the dark, soul-sucking cold of the north face, it feels like rebirth.</p>

	        <p>Renan and Cory have dropped over the ridge to get out of the wind and discovered a stone platform hanging above the south face. The sun is spread over the rock like honey. &ldquo;Lunch ledge!&rdquo; I bellow, christening our aerie.</p>

	        <p>Within minutes I&rsquo;ve got our tiny stove roaring. Renan takes off his boots and begins rubbing his toes. Cory gets out his camera and begins snapping pictures. After more than a week of climbing, this is the first time we can actually see the summit: a steep, shining pyramid of snow. But we can also see what we have left to climb: a menacing, serrated ridge of rock and snow, guarded by a dozen dagger-like pinnacles.</p>

           <p><b>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do an</b> old-school adventure,&rdquo; Hilaree had said, &ldquo;an expedition to someplace still remote and unknown.&rdquo; It was the spring of 2012, and we were coming off Mount Everest. Hilaree is the toughest woman I&rsquo;ve ever met. After summiting Everest, she climbed its neighbor, Lhotse, with two torn ligaments in her ankle.</p>

	        <p>We had a lot in common. Both of us had grown up loving mountains. We were both married with two kids and trying to find a way to balance family life with expeditions. And we were both disillusioned by Everest&rsquo;s commercialism and crowds. We needed to get back to what made us climbers to begin with.</p>

	        <p>But finding someplace truly remote is tricky. A plane will take you to the North or South Pole, you can hop a helicopter to the base camp of Everest or Makalu, tourist boats cruise the Nile and the Amazon. Real remoteness&mdash;somewhere that requires days or even weeks of walking just to reach&mdash;has almost vanished from Earth.</p>

	        <p>And yet I knew a place, a mountain that had long held me in its thrall. But because of my private history with it, I was reluctant to say anything. Eventually, after bouncing ideas back and forth&mdash;Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Kazakhstan&mdash;my enthusiasm got the best of me. &ldquo;What about,&rdquo; I hesitated, &ldquo;Hkakabo Razi?&rdquo;</p>

	        <p>Hkakabo Razi (pronounced KA-kuh-bo RAH-zee) is said to be the highest peak in Southeast Asia. It is a jagged massif of black rock and white glaciers that rises improbably out of the steaming green jungles of northern Myanmar. Located just beyond the eastern edge of the Himalaya, on the border with Tibet, it was first measured by a British survey published in 1925 at 19,296 feet high. It is a peak so remote, few climbers have heard of it even today. Getting to the mountain would require a two-week trek through dense jungle riven with plunging gorges and inhabited by venomous snakes. Hilaree was hooked immediately. We were planning our expedition before we left Kathmandu.</p>

	        <p>I had learned of Hkakabo in the 1980s, when I picked up a yellowed copy of <i>Burma&rsquo;s Icy Mountains</i> by British explorer Francis Kingdon-Ward. It described his 1937 expedition into the region and his audacious attempt to climb Hkakabo Razi solo. He reached almost 16,000 feet before being stymied by an insurmountable &ldquo;granite wall â€¦ beyond my powers.&rdquo;</p>

           <p>Kingdon-Ward&rsquo;s &ldquo;powers,&rdquo; as I learned from reading his many other books, were protean. A brilliant botanist, lyrical writer, indefatigable plant hunter, and purportedly a British spy, Kingdon-Ward was one of those hard-as-iron adventurers in the mold of polar voyager Roald Amundsen or Amazonian explorer Percy Fawcett. Kingdon-Ward could tramp through jungle for months on rice and tea, writing in his journal at night beside a campfire. From 1909 to 1956, he made more than 20 expeditions into Central Asia, during which he survived a fall off a cliff and one of the century&rsquo;s worst earthquakes. Along the way he collected hundreds of plants and named many, including species of rhododendrons and lilies that now adorn gardens worldwide.</p>

	        <p>I was entranced by Kingdon-Ward&rsquo;s journeys and was determined to make the first ascent of Hkakabo Razi. So in the fall of 1993, I enlisted my climbing buddies Steve Babits, Mike Moe, and Keith Spencer. We called ourselves the Wyoming Alpine Club. Mike had been my best friend since high school in Laramie, and I&rsquo;d met Keith and Steve at the University of Wyoming. Since then, Mike and I had done several first ascents in the Rockies and the first kayak descent of the Niger River in West Africa.</p>

	        <p>At that time the military junta controlling Burma&mdash;later renamed Myanmar&mdash;had declared the north off-limits to foreigners. We naively planned to avoid this obstacle by accessing the mountain from Tibet, illegally crossing the border, traveling light and fast with no porters.</p>

	        <p>We flew to Lhasa with our rucksacks and proceeded to sneak across eastern Tibet&mdash;also closed to foreigners&mdash;hitching rides in the backs of trucks and talking our way past checkpoints. It took more than a month just to get near the base of the mountain. Mike and Steve had to return home, leaving only Keith and me to climb. We ran out of food on the north side of Hkakabo and had to descend to a Tibetan village. There we were promptly arrested by the Chinese military, interrogated, and jailed. We signed a four-page confession of &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo; and were deported.</p>

	        <p>Two years later, to my chagrin, the Myanmar government granted Japanese mountaineer Takashi Ozaki permission to climb Hkakabo Razi. Ozaki was an unstoppable Himalayan veteran, having made the first full ascent of the north face of Everest in 1980. (He would die climbing there in 2011.) He made two failed attempts on Hkakabo in 1995, but in September 1996, after two months of climbing, Ozaki summited with Tibetan-born mountaineer Nyima Gyaltsen. He told the <i>Asia Times,</i> &ldquo;I can say absolutely that Hkakabo Razi is one of the most difficult and dangerous mountains in the world. I was never scared before, like this time.&rdquo;</p>

	        <p>Ozaki published a detailed account of his expedition, but he did not measure the summit elevation with a GPS, which left the mountain&rsquo;s exact height undetermined.</p>
            
            <img src="/2015/09/hkakabo-razi-climb/img/putao-motorcycle-caravan-525.jpg" />
            
            <p>Young and convinced of our invincibility, Mike, Keith, and I talked about returning to Hkakabo. (Steve had moved on to different adventures.) But it was not to be. Mike died on an expedition in 1995, along with his brother and two others. A bowhead whale tipped over their boat in the Arctic Ocean, and they all perished from hypothermia. Mike left behind a wife and three kids. None of us ever quite recovered.</p>
            
            <p>Still, Keith and I continued doing expeditions and often ice climbed together. On January 2, 2009, we were on the fifth pitch of an icefall in north Wyoming. I was belaying him from a small alcove in the ice. He was cheerfully climbing 15 feet below me when we heard a deafening roar. A section of ice above us had cut loose. Seconds later tons of ice crashed down. Keith was killed, his neck broken by the impact.</p>
            
            <p>There was no reason why I lived and Keith died. We&rsquo;d taken the safety precautions. He didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong, and I didn&rsquo;t do anything to save myself. There was no moral, aside from the inescapable truth that mountains are dangerous, and occasionally inflict horror and sorrow on those who dare to climb them.</p>
            
            <p><b>Lounging on our lunch ledge</b> in the sun on Hkakabo Razi, slurping down hot noodles with Cory and Renan, I am reminded of my lost friends. Mike was funny like Cory, who&rsquo;s kept us going through some of the trip&rsquo;s worst moments with perfectly timed wisecracks. Keith was quiet like Renan, always taking in the grandeur around him, always the calm voice in the midst of crisis. During these past weeks I&rsquo;ve spent with Cory and Renan, it&rsquo;s been a bit like looking back in time at myself and my dead friends. I recognize in these two younger men the same passion for climbing mountains, the same determined toughness, the same boundless ambition, and at moments the same sense of being bulletproof that Mike, Keith, and I had 22 years ago.</p>
            
            <p>Our resolve replenished, we begin to study the crenellated ridge before us that leads to the summit. Because the mountain has remained largely unexplored, we are climbing with little knowledge of the terrain. Even satellite images don&rsquo;t reveal the true difficulty of the climb. From the lunch ledge, the route ahead looks more demanding than what we&rsquo;ve encountered so far.</p>
            
            <img src="/2015/09/hkakabo-razi-climb/img/local-rawang-home-525.jpg" />
            
            <p>Hkakabo&rsquo;s west ridge is a two-mile-long saw blade&mdash;a series of stone towers separated by sharp cols of snow. Unlike on some mountains, where you can shoot right up to the summit, we have been climbing up and down the jagged ridgeline the whole way&mdash;up a tooth of rock, rappelling down the backside, balancing across a bridge of snow, then up the next craggy pinnacle. We try to identify a potential route, but the spiked ridge weaves like a serpent&rsquo;s tail so we can&rsquo;t see all the obstacles. We do, however, spot a notch that looks like the best location to bivouac for the night. We pack up and start moving, trying to stay on the sunny side of the ridge.</p>
            
            <p>It takes us four hours to reach the notch. We are so fatigued that we can barely stomp out a tent platform. Our faces are rimed with ice from breathing so hard. While trying to shove the poles into our tent, the wind lifts it like a kite. We throw in our packs, guy it down, and pile inside.</p>
            
            <p>&ldquo;The shiver bivvy begins,&rdquo; says Cory as he zips the tent, closing off the screeching blackness that has descended on the mountain.</p>
            
            <p>We knew this night was going to be misery. At camp 3 we could see that the ridge became technical and treacherous. So we ruthlessly cut the weight of our packs, bringing only bare essentials, hoping it would be enough to get us to the top and back down. We left our winter sleeping bags and carried only the thin overbag shells. We have one stove, one fuel bottle, one pot, one spoon, two instant pasta meals, and the three of us are crammed into a two-person tent.</p>
            
            <p>Sitting knee-to-knee, our backs pressed against the tent, we set our stove on our boots and nearly asphyxiate ourselves boiling water from snow. One person holds the stove, another the pot. We are wearing everything we have. Only our headlamps and runny noses stick out from beneath the hoods of our parkas. Renan says little, which is normal. But even Cory is quiet.</p>
            
            <p>We have been sleeping with each other for weeks, like poor brothers in one bed. We know each other&rsquo;s secrets. I know Renan is dealing with the betrayal of a friend. I know Cory&rsquo;s struggling to stay married and be a world-traveling photographer. They know I&rsquo;m haunted by memories of my dead friends, that this mountain is my white whale. My thoughts drift to how close we are to our goal and our team&rsquo;s ugly fight and the toll it&rsquo;s taken on my friendship with Hilaree.</p>
            
            <p>Together we traverse the first of a series of large rock spires. To either side, a mile below us, is an ocean of clouds. If one of us were to slip off the lance-like ridge, the only way to save his life would be for the next climber on the rope to quickly throw himself off the opposite side, both men praying in the millisecond of potential oblivion that the rope isn&rsquo;t pulled taut over a knife-sharp rock and severed. This is the depth of trust required in mountain climbing. This is how you transcend yourself and bond with your climbing partners. It is the reason we climb.</p>
            
            <p>We gather on a little point of snow to reassess. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared,&rdquo; Cory says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really [expletive] scared. I think we should turn around.&rdquo;</p>
            
            <p>His naked honesty is strangely comforting. He&rsquo;s saying what we all feel. But Renan and I aren&rsquo;t ready to turn back. I lead down around a snowcapped block, up through a narrow hallway between two slabs of rock, hook along a crescent of snow, and suddenly the entire route to the summit appears before me. I am aghast.</p>
            
            <p>We knew we had one more deep notch in the ridge to negotiate, but I see now that it is filled with massive stone teeth, like the jawbone of a dinosaur. It would take us hours, well into the night, to climb through this wind-gnashed maw. To summit would require another night on the mountain, but this time without a tent, stove, food, or water. We would be perched on a ledge on the side of the mountain in the wind in the dark, and we would freeze to death. It is the point of no return.</p>
            
            <p>I realize we will not reach the top. We will not measure the height of Hkakabo Razi. We will not solve the mystery of Myanmar&rsquo;s tallest mountain. I have been carrying a photo of Mike Moe and Keith Spencer for the entire expedition. In it, Mike and Keith are standing on a mountain wearing puffy down coats, helmets, and wide grins. I so fiercely wanted to place this picture on the summit. But it is not to be. I paw out a little hole and place the photo in the snow. I take a GPS reading at our high point, 18,841 feet, then climb slowly back along the ridge to Renan and Cory. They already know our expedition is over. All we want now is to get down alive.</p>
